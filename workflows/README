PM Spec:
Our workflows are designed by our clients. They are essentially a collection of
actions we take with our vendors.  Some actions are very expensive, so we only
make them if we have to.

You will receive an array of strings. Each string is a set of comma separated 
values.  The first value of each is an action to be run, that must happen AFTER
each of the rest of the values in the string. 

The expected output is a list of actions in an acceptable order.

Basic example input/output:

input = [
	"travel,dress,eat",
	"dress,shower"
]

Drawn out, it would look like:
+------------+     +------------+
|            |     |            |
|   shower   |---->|   dress    |     +------------+            
|            |     |            |---->|            |
+------------+     +------------+     |            |
                                      |   travel   |
                   +------------+     |            |
                   |            |---->|            |
                   |    eat     |     +------------+            
                   |            |
                   +------------+

valid output order:
shower
dress
eat
travel

an alternative valid output:
shower
eat
dress
travel

How would you implement this?

Lets try it with this a more realistic second dataset: Does it still work?

input = [
  "Address,Name",
  "IPAddress,Address",
  "Passport,SocialSecurityNumber,DateOfBirth",
  "Email,Passport,DateOfBirth",
]
